This is a very simple card matching game using the pygame library. It was a first attempt to teach my 10 year old daughter how to program. I think she enjoyed the process and liked playing the game for a day or so. But I'm not sure she absorbed much from the experience, other than the fact that you can actually create your own games by writing software (and that she can draw pretty pictures using Gimp). It's a start!
